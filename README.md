Implementation of dynamic routing:
  I designed a multi-layered decision-making process to evaluate the priority of each route. This includes parsing AS paths, calculating local preference values, evaluating source types for routes, etc.
  Use priority queues to store routes in forwarding tables to quickly select the best path.
